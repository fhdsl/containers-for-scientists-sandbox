# Activity 0: Getting started with Docker

Go here to [install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started), following the instructions for your particular operating system.

If you don't have a Docker account create an account when prompted, or [go here](https://hub.docker.com/).
After you install Docker, start up Docker desktop by double clicking on the app. It may take some time to start up.

## Activity 1: Pull and run a Docker image

### Step 1: Docker pull

<input type="checkbox"> We need to get the Docker **image** we want to use. We do this by "pulling" it.

Run this command in your Terminal or Command Prompt window:

```
docker pull cansav09/practice-image:1
```

### Step 2: Check what images you have

<input type="checkbox"> To see what images we have we can run `docker image ls` and we should see `cansav09/practice-image:1` show up now.

### Step 3: Run the docker image to start a container!

<input type="checkbox"> Now if want to launch the image for use, we can use `docker run` to turn it into a **container**

```
docker run cansav09/practice-image:1
```

<input type="checkbox"> To see what containers we have running we have we can run:

```
docker ps
```

### Step 4: Run a single command

<input type="checkbox"> To run stuff interactively from the command line we can do:

```
docker exec -it <PUT_CONTAINER_ID_HERE> bash
```

### Step 5: Try calling a script

<input type="checkbox"> To run a script using the docker container we could just add reference to a script at the end:

**BUT! You will find that this command won't work yet though, why?**

```
docker exec -it <PUT_CONTAINER_ID_HERE> bash run_analysis.sh
```

This won't work because the file `run_analysis.sh` is not a file that our container has. Docker containers do not have all the files that our computer does; they only have the files we add to it.

```
bash: run_analysis.sh: No such file or directory
```

## Activity 1b: Add a volume to the image

Our container is separate from our computer so if we want to use a file we have to attach it using a "volume".

### Step 1: Let’s add our containers-for-scientists-sandbox files

Point it so the volume has the workshop files

If we want to run `run_analysis.sh` there's two ways we could get our files on there.

- We could download the files we need from online! We could `git clone` files from a repository or otherwise `wget` or `curl` files.
- We could add a `volume` of files that are local to our computer. For this we will use the You'll `-v` or volume option.

### Step 2: Let’s add our containers-for-scientists-sandbox files

We can specify a particular file path on our computer or give it `$PWD` Then optionally we can give a `:` and a file path we'd like this to be stored on on the container. Otherwise it will be stored at the absolute top of the container.

<input type="checkbox"> Now we can run:
```
docker run -v $PWD:/home cansav09/practice-image:1
```

### Step 3: Retry calling the script

<input type="checkbox"> Now we can run:
```
docker exec -it <REPLACE_WITH_CONTAINER_ID> bash /home/run_analysis.sh
```

Now we have a new error! What does this mean?

**Question: Does our container have all of the same software that our computer has?**
